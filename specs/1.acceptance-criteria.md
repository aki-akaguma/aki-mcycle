# `aki-mcycle` Acceptance Criteria (EARS Format)

This document outlines the acceptance criteria for the `aki-mcycle` utility using the Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax (EARS).

## Event-Driven Criteria

These criteria describe the system's response to specific triggers or events.

- **AC1:** When a user pipes text into the application, the system shall read the complete text from standard input.
- **AC2:** When the application receives input text, the system shall search it for all non-overlapping matches of the active regular expression.
- **AC3:** When one or more matches are found, the system shall apply a cyclical color sequence to each consecutive match.
- **AC4:** When text processing is complete, the system shall print the resulting text to standard output.
- **AC5:** When no matches are found in the input text, the system shall print the original, unmodified text to standard output.
- **AC6:** When the user launches the application with the `-H` or `--help` flag, the system shall display a help message and exit.
- **AC7:** When the user launches the application with the `-V` or `--version` flag, the system shall display version information and exit.

## Optional Feature Criteria

These criteria describe behavior that depends on whether a specific feature is enabled or configured.

- **AC8:** Where the user provides a regular expression using the `-e` or `--exp` command-line options, the system shall use that expression for matching.
- **AC9:** Where the user does not provide a regular expression via command-line options, the system shall use the default regular expression `' ([0-9A-Z]{3,}):'`.
- **AC10:** Where the user has defined environment variables for color sequences (`AKI_MCYCLE_COLOR_SEQ_*`), the system shall use those values for colorization.
- **AC11:** Where the user has not defined custom color sequence environment variables, the system shall use the default color cycle: Red, Green, Blue, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow.
